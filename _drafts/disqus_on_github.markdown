## disqus_on_github

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21446165/how-do-i-use-disqus-comments-in-github-pages-blog-markdown

```
The easiest and cleanest way to do it is to create a partial with the HTML that disqus provides in your _includes/ folder (e.g. _includes/disqus.html) and then just including it in your posts layout file (e.g. _layouts/post.md):

include disqus.html
```
